# NCDC Storm Events Database Analysis

## Introduction

I am an MBA student at Bridgewater State University, enrolled in MGMT582 - Business Intelligence/Analytics.  This data exploration project is intended to be my final project and in-class presentation.  The goal of this project is to gain practical working experience with R Studio and to apply some data analysis techniques in which we have been introduced within this course.

I have chosen to work with the NCDC Storm Events Database available at DATA.gov.  For more details related to this raw data set, see <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ncdc-storm-events-database>.

## Data Mining Study

My completed data mining study is available with my markdown document entitled 'Data-Exploration.md'.  This document was prepared with R Studio and Knitr and is intended to represent a reproducible report identifying the original data source, methods deployed for getting and cleaning this data, scripts executed to analyze this data, and finally my final steps taken to produce a visualization of this data.

## Final Report

I am preparing a final report of my completed project and it will be uploaded here to GitHub as a PDF document entitled 'JWELCH-Data-Analytics-R-Programming.pdf'.  Thank you for your interest in this study.
